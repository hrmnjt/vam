`vam!` expands to Vertica Access Management. This is a work in progress project 
and is very crude and might have side effects which are not handled as of now. 
**Use with caution!**


## Usage

_At this moment the CLI functionality can be tested and the CLi actually 
doesn't issue commands to modules. I intend to make triggers work post module
functionality is complete_

```bash
go run vam.go
# vam! is an opiniated vertica access management

# vam is designed to compliment the user and role
# access that have been setup on your installation
# of Vertica database. It is majorly a command line
# interface that exposes simple APIs to interact
# with Vertica database

# Usage:
#   vam [command]

# Available Commands:
#   apply       apply proposed changed for vam!
#   init        initializing vam!
#   plan        planning changed for vam!

# Flags:
#       --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.vam.yaml)
#   -h, --help            help for vam
#   -v, --version         version for vam

# Use "vam [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Project structure

`vam!` follows standard Go project structure as suggested in
