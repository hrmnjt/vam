`vam!` expands to Vertica Access Management. This is a work in progress project 
and is very crude and might have side effects which are not handled as of now. 
**Use with caution!**


## Usage

_At this moment the CLI functionality can be tested and the CLi actually 
doesn't issue commands to modules. I intend to make triggers work post module
functionality is complete_

go run cmd/vam.go
