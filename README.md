`vam!` expands to Vertica Access Management. This is a work in progress project 
and is very crude and might have side effects which are not handled as of now.

### Goals for project

High level outcomes of the project is to provide access management in 
declarative approach. Below would be good goals to achieve as part of the 
project implementation.

- **Bootstrap**: get current access related configurations from existing 
vertica cluster

- **Declare**: declare a change in access configuration which is evaluated 
against the current setup and results are indicated

- **Apply**: apply a change in access configuration as per declared changes

> Initial project design is highly influenced by 
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) given the success of IaC paradigm 
with declarative code. `vam` is config driven approach based on similar 
principles.

### Non-goals for project

- `vam` adds onto access functions provided by Vertica default instead of 
branching away. The idealogy is to remain a logical wrapper instead of 
alternate access control methods

### Future goals

- RESTful API
- UI to declare and apply changes

## Solution

<!-- TODO: current vertica access control design -->
### Existing Vertica access control

TBD

### `vam` design

#### External conncetions - existing Vertica DB using native client libraries


#### Logic

<!-- TODO: Improve BOOTSTRAP logical flow -->
##### Bootstrap

**Step 1 - connect to an existing Vertica DB**

**Step 2 - gather essential details**

- Get roles
- Get users
- Get resource pools
- Get storage locations
- Get client authentication
- Get databases
- Get libraries
- Get procedures
- Get tables
- Get views

**Step 3 - format bootstrap information as logical data structures as part of 
configuration**

<!-- TODO: add DECLARE logical flow -->
##### Declare

TBD

<!-- TODO: add APPLY logical flow -->
##### Apply

TBD

<!-- TODO: add data model details -->
#### Data model

TBD

<!-- TODO: curate below block as per BOOTSTRAP step -->
##### bootstrap

**Step 1 - create roles based on existing roles**

- `role_name`
- `role_description`
- `role_tags`
- `role_id`
- `created_ts`
- `updated_ts`

**Step 2 - User creation**

- `user_name`
- `user_is_locked`
- `user_resource_pool`
- `user_memory_cap`
- `user_temp_space_cap`
- `user_runtime_cap`
- `user_max_connection`
- `user_idle_session_timeout`
- `user_search_path`
- `user_description`
- `user_tags`
- `user_id`
- `created_ts`
- `updated_ts`
