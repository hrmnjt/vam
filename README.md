`vam!` expands to Vertica Access Management. This is a work in progress project 
and is very crude and might have side effects which are not handled as of now.

## Technical Specifications

### Overview

`vam` expands to Vertica Access Management.

Vertica is an analytical database which is built with MPP architecture to power 
demanding workloads for reporting and analytics.

Access Mananagment is a tricky affair when it comes to analytics. Many 
organizations don't worry too much about access control and managing access to 
data. But when PII information gets mixed with financial and customer behavior 
data it becomes imperative to worry about controlling access to data.

`vam` is an opiniated access management tool built on top of Vertica's 
inbuilt SQL based GRANT dialects in order to handle access management for a 
medium to large scale analytics organization.

### Goals for project

Most important goal for `vam` is to fill in gaps for excel sheets and notepad 
script that are created to manage access to Vertica database using the inbuilt
SQL based GRANT directives.

An opiniated approach to manage access rights and control lists is to define 
them in a declarative approach. Most important work to be done by `vam` would 
be to `declare` a change and `apply` changes to Vertica

- **Declare**: declare a change in access configuration which is evaluated 
against the current setup and results are indicated

- **Apply**: apply a change in access configuration as per declared changes

Additionally, it is hard to `declare` changes to access roles if you don't know 
which accesses are currently granted to each users or role. Hence, additional 
role would be to `bootstrap` the current access list into a fixed format which 
could serve as a reference.

- **Bootstrap**: get current access related configurations from existing 
vertica cluster

All of this is supposed to be a CLI based operation. It would work from any 
command line terminal which has access to the database directly.

> Initial project design is highly influenced by 
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) given the success of IaC paradigm 
with declarative code. `vam` is config driven approach based on similar 
principles.

### Non-goals for project (or boundaries for `vam`)

- `vam` adds onto access functions provided by Vertica instead of branching 
away. The idealogy is to remain a logical wrapper instead of alternate access 
control approach.

- `vam` is purely a CLI tool; at least for now, till it matures for its users.
